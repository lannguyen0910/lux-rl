r"""" Game Strategy
- Build only one city that is constantly growing
- Build new city tiles only when we have enough fuel for them for at least 2 next night (or until the end)
- Build no more than 1 city tile per step
- All units go to city before night
- Whenever having a chance, build a new worker (and never cart)
- Have a straightforward collision avoidance approach
